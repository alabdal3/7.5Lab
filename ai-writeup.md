AI Tool Effectiveness in This Assignment
ChatGPT and Deepseek were really useful in getting me started on this assignment. They gave me structured code snippets and explanations that helped lay the groundwork. But one of the more frustrating parts was how confident they were, even when they were wrong. A lot of the code they generated needed tweaking to actually work with what I was building.
One of the biggest issues was handling API requests efficiently. The AI suggested an approach that sounded good in theory but wasnâ€™t the right fit for what I needed. On the flip side, it gave some solid Tailwind CSS class suggestions, but I still had to adjust a bunch of them to get things looking right on the screen.
Overall, the AI was super helpful for brainstorming and structuring my project, but its overconfidence in incorrect solutions made debugging take longer. Still, it was a great tool for refining the final version.
